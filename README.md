#  Rat in a Maze 

##  Project Overview

This project implements the classic **Rat in a Maze** problem using **recursive backtracking** in C++. The goal is to find a valid path for the rat to move from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (n-1, n-1) of a user-defined maze grid, following only allowed paths (cells with value 1).

The solution also features:
- Interactive menu-driven interface
- Stack-based path tracking
- Score tracking across multiple games

##  Key Features

-  **Backtracking-based solver**
-  **Stack storage** of the solution path
-  **Score tracking** for multiple plays
-  **Dynamic memory management**
-  **Clean input-output structure**
-  **Cross-platform note**: Uses `system("cls")` for clearing screen (works on Windows)
